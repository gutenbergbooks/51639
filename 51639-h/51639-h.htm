<p>Over fifty million dollars is lost every
year on American farms because implements
and machinery are not properly
housed. Is part of this wasted on
YOUR farm?</p>

<p>Protection of farm machinery in well
built implement sheds means dollars
earned through dollars saved. On the
average farm an implement shed saves
annually as much as the income from
$1,800 at interest.</p>

<i>By K. J. T. Ekblaw</i></p>

<p class="blankabove">A very fair indication of the thrift and general prosperity
of a farmer is the method he employs in caring for
his tools. Shiftlessness, waste, lack of energy, constant buying
and heavy burdens of debt will accompany poor care.
Good care is an indication of shrewdness, business ability,
long-lived machinery, comfortable bank balances and the
assurance of a peaceful, prosperous future.</p>

<p>To the progressive man, figures speak more forcibly
than does the most persuasive lecturer on economic topics.
The report of the United States Census for 1910 contains
some figures that bear a distinct message to the farmers of
the country. In 1900 the value of all farm property in the
shape of farm implements and machinery was $749,775,970;
in 1910 this same value had increased to $1,265,149,783,
representing an increase of 68.7 per cent. This increase can
be ascribed mainly to increased quantity rather than to
higher prices, for the increase in price of farm machinery has
been comparatively slight. It means that the farmers are
realizing the benefits to be derived from the use of labor-saving
machinery. In 1900 the acreage of improved land in
farms was 414,498,487; in 1910 this became 478,451,750, an
increase of only 15.4 per cent. These figures may be a little
more significant if expressed in the following way: In 1900
there was $1.80 worth of machinery for each acre of improved
farm land; in 1910 this had increased to $2.65, or an
increase of over 47 per cent.</p>

<p>These figures will immediately indicate an opportunity
for the furtherance of economic agriculture. With so much
capital invested in equipment, the American farmer would
certainly be a very bad business man indeed if he did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page4"></span>
take some means of protecting this equipment to reduce depreciation
and to increase its length of life. The question
has sometimes been asked, does it pay to house farm machinery?
Is it not a better practice not to give any special
care to the machinery but use it as long as it will run without
care then buy newer and more up-to-date equipment?</p>

<p>The situation bears some consideration. According to
Census figures, the average investment per farm in farm machinery
is almost exactly $200. This, however, is the case
when every sort of farm is included, and since the Census
Bureau&#8217;s definition of a farm is extremely liberal it would
not be practical for our purposes. A fair estimate of the
average value of farm machinery on a farm is $1,000. No
reliable figures are available to indicate the rate of depreciation
of farm machinery; one farmer will take excellent care
of his binder and it may do service for twenty or twenty-five
years, while another farmer will leave his binder in the
middle of the field where the last stalk of grain was cut, and
it would be surprising if his machine could operate satisfactorily
for more than five seasons. To take ten years as the
average life of farm machinery is certainly to be considered
conservative.</p>

<p>Most farm machines are well and substantially constructed
and will render satisfactory and efficient service
with slight repairs for a much longer term of years than the
average which has just been given. It is entirely safe to
assume that the average length of efficient service can be
increased to fifteen years providing proper care is given. It
is almost equally safe to assume that the average life of
uncared-for machinery will not be much more than five years.</p>

<p>The farmer who has a thousand dollars worth of machinery
to which he gives no care and attention will then
have an annual reduction in value of $200, besides his interest
charge of $60 on his investment or a total debit of $260. The
farmer who properly houses his machinery will have an
annual deduction of $66.66 for depreciation and the same
interest charge of $60. He will have, in addition, an annual
charge of $25 for interest and depreciation on his building
if it cost $250, or a total of $151.66, which is $108.34 less than
that of his improvident neighbor. The careful farmer then
may consider that he has in his implement house an investment
representing over $1,800 as shown by the saving it
brings him; as a simple implement shed can be built for $250,
a net profit of an interest-paying $1,550 remains. Putting
the problem in another way, on many farms the savings on
machinery will pay for a shed in two or three years.</p>

simple and satisfactory construction. The front wall may be omitted in localities

<p>In view of the fact that the small tractor is becoming an
extremely popular source of farm power, special consideration
should be given to its shelter. The tractor is an implement
that would be extremely likely to be injured as a result
of exposure to weather. It is entirely possible that the
damage which may be done to this one single machine in one
winter&#8217;s exposure may be sufficient to pay for the cost of
a machine shed which will house all the implements on the
farm.</p>

<p>So much for the economic side. The figures that have
just been given relate only to a very conservative case. On
many farms the saving would be a great deal more. Besides
this there are other things of which the value cannot be estimated,
such as the benefit of having a machine that will
operate when it is called upon to do so; the added value an
implement shed gives to the farm; and the additional prestige
which will redound to the owner of the farm.</p>

<p>The careful farmer will, of course, find that criticisms of
ill-cared-for machinery do not apply to him; he has a machine
shed, and knows the value of paint, oil, and grease in extending
the life of implements. His equipment always looks
new, for as rust breaks through the protecting coat of paint,
a new coat is immediately applied; and his plowshares, discs,
cultivator shovels, and other bright parts of implements are
always given a thorough coating of grease before being put
away for the winter. As a result, his implements are ready
for business when spring comes and time is valuable.</p>

<h2>THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING</h2>

<p>In preparing the design for machine sheds one of the
first considerations is that of economy. A machine shed is
a building which is almost always used for no other purpose
than to shelter machinery. It is not like a bin for the storage
of grain where strength is an exceedingly important factor
nor is it like a barn where so many operations are carried on
within; consequently the simplest and cheapest structure
that is consistent with reasonable durability is the one that
is the most advisable. Wood is a product available in every
section and is the cheapest and most suitable material for
the construction of an implement shed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig6">

<p class="caption">Fig. 6. Details of Open Type of Implement Shed</p>

<p class="captionjust">Framing of 6x6 posts, thoroughly braced. Ends may be boarded or left
open as desired. Foundation piers act as wheel guards. Width between posts
can be varied to suit requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>Paint, the great preservative, should be applied to all<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a><br /><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
farm buildings. The initial cost of two coats of good paint
is not prohibitive; the durability of the wood may be increased
almost indefinitely if the surface is kept covered to
prevent the ingress of the spores of decay. The prosperous
farmer&#8217;s buildings are always kept painted, not only to preserve
the wood, but to improve the appearance of the buildings
themselves.</p>

<p>On new wood, two coats are usually sufficient. The first
coat should contain mainly oil, with a small amount of the
base and coloring pigments, so that it will permeate every
pore; the second coat should be heavier, containing less oil
and more pigment. Surfaces that have been painted can be
kept in good condition by the occasional application of a
single coat.</p>

<p>The planning of an implement shed will require data as
to the number and size of machines and the amount of space
that each will occupy. The arrangement of the machines
so as to make them easily accessible at times when they are
most needed is also important, e. g., a binder being used but
once a year may well occupy a far corner, leaving a space
near the door for the mower and plow, implements which
are used oftener and for longer periods than the binder. The
manure spreader, wagons and buggies are used so much
throughout the year that they should be especially accessible.
<a href="#Table1">Table I</a>, pages 19 and 20, gives the floor space required
for most farm machines; the height of the machine
is also given. Of course, it is entirely possible to crowd
machines together as they are put into the shed, and so much
saving in room can be accomplished in this way that little
clearance space need be left. For instance, the outer edge
of a binder platform can be easily raised several feet, provided
a pair of reel slats with the attached arms are removed,
and in this space beneath the platform can be stored such
implements as hand drill, walking plows, etc. Similar opportunities
for economy in space can very easily be found.</p>

</div>

<p>In general the construction of a machine shed is that of
the very simplest; yet utility and beauty can be very easily
combined with simplicity. Since the building is not subjected
to any heavy load, as would be the case with a crib or a
barn, the framing is just sufficiently strong to safely hold the
wall and roof covering and to prevent collapse of the building
from wind or snow and ice loads. Very often 2x4&#8217;s or 4x4&#8217;s
constitute the studs or posts and no heavier stock is used
throughout the building. In wide sheds it may be found<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a><br /><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
necessary to use larger stuff and especially in the plate above
the wide doorway. A two-story machine shed will, of course,
require heavier and more substantial framing, but a two-story
shed is comparatively rare. A floor may or may not
be used as the owner may desire. It is likely to prove somewhat
expensive in first cost and in maintenance, though for
convenience it is much to be desired, especially if any repair
work is to be done in the building.</p>

<p>The roof may be of almost any style from the simple
single pitch shed roof to the modified shed roof or the
ordinary double pitch gable roof. It is desirable that the
pitch should be not less than one-quarter in order to get the
greatest life out of the shingles, which are likely to collect
moisture and give shorter service where the pitch is quite
flat. The foundation of a machine shed will naturally not be
designed for great strength except in the case of a two-story
structure, since the only load which it has to support is that
of the superstructure itself. A footing 12 to 16 inches wide
at the bottom and extending down a foot or 15 inches into
solid soil will support a building of this kind. However,
if a concrete floor is put in the building as is sometimes
done in the more expensive ones, it will be well to extend
the foundation wall and footing to a point below the frost
line, which will vary from a foot to three feet according to
climate.</p>

<p>Sills are usually not necessary in the simple framing of
machine sheds. The posts can be set directly upon foundation
walls and fastened in any one of many different ways
that have been devised. Timbers are more subject to decay
at the ends than elsewhere, consequently it is advisable to
treat them at this point with a preservative such as creosote.
This will add greatly to the durability. The foundation wall
should be brought up some distance above the ground so as
to further protect the bottom timbers from moisture. This
above-ground extension must be omitted at doorways.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig9">
<img src="images/illo016.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="480" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 9. Details of a Wide Enclosed Implement Shed</p>

<p class="captionjust">Strong framing is necessary to insure durability in this structure. Members
may be solid or built up. Details of one form of roof truss are shown in
<a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>. Note solid foundation. Doors may be located to suit requirements.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the most serious problems in the design of a
machine shed is the insertion of doors. Wide doors are an
absolute necessity, especially for certain machines. An
eight-foot door is large enough for the majority of farm
machines, even allowing the modern binder with its folding
grain dividers to enter in safety. The wide drill, the rake,
and several other implements require a much wider door than
this and it may be necessary to provide an opening 12 or
even 14 feet wide. This leaves a long unsupported section<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><br /><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
of the plate directly above the doorway. To keep it and the
roof from sagging, special provision must be made either by
putting in an exceptionally strong plate at this point, by
building up a small wooden truss, or by making a truss of
wood and iron as shown in the illustration. (<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>.)</p>

<p>The doors themselves should be very solidly and substantially
made. It is a matter of good practice to have as
few doors as possible. In the average machine shed one
8-foot door and one 12 or 14-foot door are sufficient to meet
requirements. A door wider than four feet should not be
swung on hinges under any circumstances, as it is sure
to pull out the hinges or to sag very badly. Sliding doors of
good construction are to be recommended in preference to
hinged doors (<a href="#Fig12">Fig. 12</a>). It is entirely possible to make a
good close-fitting door of this type and there need never be
any trouble in its operation.</p>

<p>The use of other buildings for the storage of farm implements
is not a desirable procedure except in certain instances,
such as keeping wagons in the driveway of cribs, leaving
the spreader at the end of an alleyway of a barn for convenience
in loading, etc. In general, other buildings are
much more expensive than a machine shed and those portions
of them devoted to the storage of farm implements
could in most cases be more profitably used, especially when
the very small unit floor-space cost of a machine shed is taken
into consideration. Then, too, if a special place is not provided
for the implements, the farm animals may come in
contact with them, causing injury of the animals or damage
to the machines.</p>

<h2>REPRESENTATIVE TYPES OF SHEDS</h2>

<h3>The Simple Shed Type.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The needs of the average farm
for a cheap, easily built implement shed are met by this building.
Illustrations of this type of shed are shown in <a href="#Fig1">Figs. 1</a>, <a href="#Fig2">2</a>
and <a href="#Fig3">3</a>. The framing consists of 6x6 posts set on a light
1:2&frac12;:5 mixture concrete foundation at intervals of eight
feet, the plate consisting of two 2x6&#8217;s. Short diagonal braces
can be set in underneath between the plate and the post in order
to give the plate further support. The rafters for a span
of 18 feet should be at least 2x6 and better 2x8, set not less
than two feet apart on centers. The wall covering may consist
of vertical siding, either 10 or 12-inch boards, with the
cracks covered by ogee battens. For horizontal siding,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><br /><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
studs are necessary; these should be 2x4&#8217;s, placed not over 3
feet apart. Either drop-siding, German or novelty siding or
ordinary weather-boarding may be used satisfactorily, but
the latter is somewhat light for a building of this kind and
would probably not be as durable as the others mentioned.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 11. Roof Truss Details</p>

<p class="captionjust">The upper illustration (<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>) shows a method of building a truss above
wide doors to prevent sagging of roof. It may be varied to suit circumstances.</p>

<p class="captionjust up1">The roof trusses shown in <a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a> suggest methods of framing for wide
sheds, as in <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a> and <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The building may be entirely enclosed, having the doors
on the high side. The practice of enclosing the building
entirely is generally to be recommended, though sometimes
for the sake of economy and convenience and in localities
where the winds are very constant in their direction, it may
be advisable to omit part of the exterior wall covering, leaving
one side open, this side being the one opposite to the
direction from which the prevailing winds come.</p>

<h3>The Open Shed Type.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Under some circumstances the
open shed type of building (shown in <a href="#Fig4">Figs. 4</a>, <a href="#Fig5">5</a> and <a href="#Fig6">6</a>) will be
the more suitable. This is especially true where wagons,
racks and spreaders are used frequently. The framing of the
building consists simply of 6x6 posts set on concrete piers at
intervals of 9 feet. On these are set 2x6 rafters supporting
a double pitched gable roof. The building is opened on
both sides but both ends may be enclosed.</p>

<p>This building is extremely convenient, although it does
not give very thorough protection to the machines. A
wagon or spreader can be driven directly through one of
the bays and horses unhitched outside. With a building 18
feet wide and eaves overhanging one foot, the implements
will be protected from all but driving rains, though sweeping
snow will have free access to the interior. The posts are
placed nine feet apart in order to provide sufficient room
for driving a team through. It may be possible to reduce
this dimension to eight feet, or to increase it to 10 feet in
case a three-horse team is to be driven through. The concrete
piers supporting the posts are made conical in shape,
acting thus as wheel guards to prevent the hubs of the
wheels from striking the posts.</p>

<p>One or more bays of the shed may be enclosed if desired
to give adequate shelter to machines, such as mowers, binders,
etc., which would suffer from exposure. Of course, the
shed as well as the preceding one can be built to any length
desired, though a building more than four times as long as
it is wide will present a somewhat peculiar appearance on
account of the long, low roof line.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo020b.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="574" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 12. Construction Details</p>

<p class="captionjust">These details apply in general to the implement shed plans. The girder
splice shown makes a firm, solid joint. If double hung sash are used, standard
window framing is employed, as shown. Wide doors are always hung on a
track; the detail shows weather strip at top, and bracket with roller at bottom
to keep door from swinging out.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Wide Enclosed Type.</h3>

<p class="noindent">A better and a little more
expensive type of implement shed, yet one perhaps better
suited to the average farm is shown in <a href="#Fig7">Figs. 7</a>, <a href="#Fig8">8</a> and <a href="#Fig9">9</a>. This
shed is made 26 feet in width and as long as may be necessary,
although a building 26x40 will usually be found sufficiently
large to house the machines on the average general-purpose
farm. The framing of this shed is a little more substantial
than in the types previously discussed, consisting of
6x6&#8217;s with 4x6 plates. Should horizontal siding be used,
it will naturally follow that instead of using these posts, 2x4
studs will be employed as previously described in the simple
shed type on page thirteen. The height of the walls should
be not less than 10 feet, which with the gable roof will make
the building a little more attractive in appearance than the
one previously described. A span of 26 feet is almost too
great for the adequate support of the roof unless some device
such as truss bracing and purline is used to give the rafters
additional stiffness. (<a href="#Fig11">Fig. 11</a>.)</p>

<p>Experience has shown that the two widths&mdash;18 feet and
26 feet are peculiarly adaptable to the dimensions of the
various farm machines. Using the 26-foot width, considerable
opportunity is given for the utilization of the floor space,
since a wider floor area unsupported by posts is available.
As far as possible, interior posts should be avoided, for
they interfere very seriously in the placing and moving of
machinery.</p>

<h3>The Two-Story Type.</h3>

<p class="noindent">As stated before, the use of a
two-story machine shed is rather rare, for two reasons: First,
the additional expense in material and labor, and, Second,
the difficulty of getting machines up to the second floor.
The only advantage that is gained is the doubling of the
floor space under the same roof.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="Fig13">
<img src="images/illo022.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="559" />
<p class="caption">Fig. 13. Details of Two-Story Implement Shed</p>

<p class="captionjust">The framing in this type of shed must be unusually strong and substantial.
The girders and, in fact, all framing members, may be either solid or built up.
A central post is necessary in each framing unit.</p>
</div>

<p>The construction of the building (illustrated in <a href="#Fig13">Figs. 13</a>,
<a href="#Fig14">14</a> and <a href="#Fig15">15</a>) will necessarily be rather substantial. The framing
may consist of 6x6 posts and 4x6 girts, which should be
securely joined in order to give rigidity to the structure.
The girts are located at vertical intervals of not to exceed
5 feet, so as to afford good nailing for vertical siding. If
horizontal siding is used, the girts may be spaced wider,
say, one each at the top, bottom, and middle of the post, while
2x6 studs are set in on which to nail the boards. Diagonal
bracing is a decided advantage. The building may be constructed
either 18 or 26 feet wide, and it is seldom that a<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><br /><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
building longer than 40 feet will be necessary. The foundation
should be much more substantial than in the types
previously described. It should extend well below the frost
line and be almost as strong as that used for barns.</p>

<p>The second floor will be used for the storage of the
lighter machines such as small plows, harrows, drills and all
the lighter tools which make up the farmer&#8217;s equipment;
while the first floor will be utilized for the storage of the
heavier machines such as binders, wagons, etc. Getting the
lighter machines up to the second floor may be accomplished
in one of two ways. An ordinary block and tackle can be
utilized either through an outside door in the gable of the
roof or through a hole in the floor in the interior of the
building. If space is available the construction of a rather
steep runway outside the building and leading to the second
floor may be advantageous. This runway can be constructed
of rather light material, using a pair of 4x6&#8217;s for joists, and
flooring them with rough 2-inch stuff. An angle of 30 degrees
with the horizontal will make it possible to pull
machines up the runway with only a small amount of labor.
This arrangement has been found to be superior to the use
of a hoist. It can be used to the best advantage when the
shed is located on the slope of a rather steep hill.</p>

<p class="blankabove">The legitimate use of lumber where it is best, or by
proper selection or treatment can be made to serve economically
and safely, is the aim of the lumbermen in publishing
a series of bulletins on Farm Structures. Wood has
for so long been the most widely used building material that
its availability and importance have either been taken for
granted or lost sight of. It is helpful to review the outstanding
features of the present situation:</p>

<div class="smallbold">

<p>Wood remains the most universal, most adaptable building material in the
world.</p>

<p>The supply is ample for all requirements, and the kinds and grades best
suited for all purposes are obtainable everywhere.</p>

<p>In cost it remains one of the cheapest materials.</p>

<p>It is the lightest building material known, and the strongest, weight for
weight.</p>

<p>Its qualities are known; it is easy to work; it can be cut and shaped by any
one into the myriad uses required for the shelter and comfort of man.</p>

<p>There is no material more beautiful in appearance, more susceptible to
artistic finish, nor which is as productive of sentiment and satisfaction for home
building.</p>

<p>Wood is a non-conductor of heat,&mdash;cool in summer and warm in winter.</p>

</div><!--smallbold-->

<p>The relative qualities of durability, serviceability and
workability should be considered in selecting wood for
homes and farm buildings. <b>Consult the local lumber dealer.</b>
His knowledge and advice will assure cheaper, more stable
buildings.</p>

<p>Except where naturally durable woods are available, a
preservative treatment will prove economical for timber exposed
to moisture and decay, as sills, basement flooring,
fence posts; and in similar situations.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
